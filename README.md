## About eVoting-System
eVoting-System is a locally hosted electronic system built as a prototype for larger multi-node internet based voting.
It is a permissioned system that allows the registeration of voters and election administrators for a set election. Authentication is two way: passwords and fingerprints. Election results are published through a linked online portal for easy access to the voters.
The system heavily relied on .Net technologies and tools for its development and deployment. 

## How to use this app
Download the desktop application and get users registered. Set up an election an give registered users access to vote
